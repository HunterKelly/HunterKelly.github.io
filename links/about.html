<h1 class="white-text">Welcome to ABOUT page</h1><br>
<div class="Column_3">
<p class="white-text">Howdy, I am a software developer who loves to code! I enjoy spending time with friends and family.
<br>
<br>I am a graduate of The Tech Academyâ€™s Software Developer Boot Camp, and trained and experienced in the following web and
programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C# and more. I plan on utilizing software development
skills to create implement
business processes for front and back-end applications.
<br><br>
Prior to enrolling in The Tech Academy, I graduated with a B.S. from Texas A&M in Renewable Natural
Resources. While attending I became Vice President of the A&M Table Tennis Organization, taking our team to nationals and placing 17th in 2016. After college,
I specialized in environmental consulting and sampling. I got the opportunity to lead drilling teams in the Gulf of Mexico,
sediment sampling for dredge projects. This is where my passion for code began. Self taught to improve existing data processes 
with how scientific data is used and analyzed. I have 2 years experience off and on(side projects) building applications including web, buisness solutions, and even video games!
<br> <br>
Lastly, I am a proud veteran of the US Air Force. After highschool, I joined and became an Aircrew Life Support Tech. We
provided, maintained, and instructed aircrew on the use of all live saving equipment aboard C-130's. I was lucky enough
to be stationed in Rammstein, Germany where we directly supported the mission in the war of Iraq. 1 Tour of duty in Ali
Al Salem, Kuwait. Served in time of war.
 <br><br>
Prior to college, I sold vehicles for Ford for 3 years. While there, I focused on personal social growth by attending
sales seminars, sales conferences, and daily practice working with customers.
